- The combination of model, purpose, variables, examples, and output creates effective prompts.
- High-quality prompts can yield 80% of results with only 20% of the effort invested.
- Static variables are fixed during development, while dynamic variables change based on context.
- Prompt chaining enables the integration of outputs from one prompt as inputs for another.
- JSON outputs provide structured data, essential for building complex AI systems and workflows.
- Clear guidelines in prompts enhance the consistency and quality of generated outputs.
- The Omni complete prompt allows for versatile applications by changing only a few variables.
- Effective prompts can drive business results through improved user interactions and experiences.
- Mastering prompt engineering is foundational for developing advanced AI agents and workflows.
- The structure of prompts influences the ease of parsing and processing generated outputs.
- Continuous improvement in prompt design leads to better performance in AI applications.

# INSIGHTS:
- The model selection is paramount; it dictates the overall effectiveness of your prompts.
- A well-defined purpose streamlines the prompt creation process and enhances clarity in results.
- Dynamic variables facilitate flexibility, allowing prompts to adapt to changing requirements easily.
- Examples within prompts guide models toward producing outputs that meet specific expectations.
- Choosing between text and JSON output shapes how data is utilized in subsequent processes.

# QUOTES:
- "The model you choose will have the biggest impact on the performance of your prompt."
- "If you write a great clear goal for your prompt, you will start to get those clear simple results."
- "Dynamic variables are variables that you're going to want to update when you're reusing your prompts."
- "Examples are really important because we can come in here and update this."
- "Text output is default; it's straightforward and useful for simpler tasks."
- "JSON outputs enable structured and reliable outputs which is crucial for building higher-order systems."
- "These are the five most important elements of the prompt."
- "By focusing on these elements, you can achieve 80% of the results with just 20% of the effort."
- "Once you master The Prompt, you can then build great prompt chains."
- "Whenever I'm creating new prompts now, this is how I like to structure it."
- "Keep prompting, keep building, and I'll see you in the next one."
  

# Four Level framework for prompt engineering
> [LLM library](https://github.com/simonw/llm)


## Level 1: Ad hoc prompt
- Quick, natural language prompts for rapid prototyping
- Perfect for exploring model capabilities and behaviors
- Can be run across multiple models for comparison
- Great for one-off tasks and experimentation
```example
Summarize the content with 3 hot takes biased toward the author and 3 hot takes biased against the author

...paste content here...
```

## Level 2: Structured prompt
- Reusable prompts with clear purpose and instructions
- Uses XML/structured format for better model performance
- Contains static variables that can be modified
- Solves well-defined, repeatable problems
```example
<purpose>
    Summarize the given content based on the instructions and example-output
</purpose>

<instructions>
   <instruction>Output in markdown format</instruction>
   <instruction>Summarize into 4 sections: High level summary, Main Points, Sentiment, and 3 hot takes biased toward the author and 3 hot takes biased against the author</instruction>
   <instruction>Write the summary in the same format as the example-output</instruction>
</instructions>

<content>
    {...} <<< update this manually
</content>
```

## Level 3: Structured prompt with example output
- Builds on Level 2 by adding example outputs
- Examples guide the model to produce specific formats
- Increases consistency and reliability of outputs
- Perfect for when output format matters
```example
<purpose>
    Summarize the given content based on the instructions and example-output
</purpose>

<instructions>
   <instruction>Output in markdown format</instruction>
   <instruction>Summarize into 4 sections: High level summary, Main Points, Sentiment, and 3 hot takes biased toward the author and 3 hot takes biased against the author</instruction>
   <instruction>Write the summary in the same format as the example-output</instruction>
</instructions>

<example-output>

    # Title

    ## High Level Summary
    ...

    ## Main Points
    ...

    ## Sentiment
    ...

    ## Hot Takes (biased toward the author)
    ...

    ## Hot Takes (biased against the author)
    ...
</example-output>

<content>
    {...} <<< update this manually
</content>
```

## Level 4: Structured prompt with dynamic content
- Production-ready prompts with dynamic variables
- Can be integrated into code and applications
- Infinitely scalable through programmatic updates
- Foundation for building AI-powered tools and agents
```example
same as level 3 example but...

<content>
    {{content}} <<< update this dynamically with code
</content>
```
